        Welcome to Connect Four

    This is a 2 player game. The goal is to get 4 pieces in a row eather orthogonally or diagonally.
    Each player takes turns after each other. Player number 1 is "O" and player number 2 is "X".
    Pieces are inserted from the top of the game board where they will fall down on the other pieces. Pieces only move in columns.
    First one who connects 4 in a row wins.

    During the game the player whose turn it is can chose a column where to put the piece. "#" columns are full and can not be used anymore.

    When pressing "PLAY" user is asked wheather they want to play classic connect four (is played on a 7x6 board) or they want to play on a custom board.
    When playing custom game board size is glamped to the min and max when going over or under the limits.

    After the game the winner is can enter his/her name (isn't required, just press Enter) to show in the leaderboard. When the game ends with a tie, there isn't a winner.

    In the main menu you can go to leaderboard where you can see previous games and their stats.

    Best of luck with your games. :)
