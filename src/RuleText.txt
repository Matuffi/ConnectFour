        Welcome to Connect Four

    This is a 2 player game. The goal is to get 4 pieces in a row eather orthogonally or diagonally.
    Each player takes turns after each other. Player number 1 is "O" and player number 2 is "X".
    Pieces are inserted from the top of the game board where they will fall down on the other pieces.
    First one who connects 4 in a row wins.

    During the game the player whose turn it is can chose a column where to put the piece. "#" columns are full and can not be used anymore.

    When pressing "PLAY" user is asked wheather they want to play classic connect four (is played on a 7x6 board) or they want to play on a custom board.
    When playing custom game board size is glamped to the min and max when going over or under the limits.
